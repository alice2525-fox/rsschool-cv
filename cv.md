I’m Alice and I’m a linguist. I specialize in literature and can read, perceive and process the information really fast. I can speak several languages such as English, Chinese and Italian. I’ve been working as an English teacher for more than 5 years and used to work abroad as well. I’m a big fan of Coursera and I always like to learn smth new when I have some free time. My goal is to master a completely different sphere in order to prove myself that everything is possible.
